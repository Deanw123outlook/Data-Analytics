# Data-Analytics
This repository will hold key data analysis work completed between 2020 and current 2023. This will be a mix of both project work completed and sample commercial work completed during this timeframe. This will give a good indication of data analysis skills built within this period.
Libraries used will include Numpy, Pandas and popular visualization libraries. Most recent work includes Azure analytics. All datasets are publically available or have been generated using Micorsoft Excel or Python to mimic similar datasets that have been worked on in the work place.
